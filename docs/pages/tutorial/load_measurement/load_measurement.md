# Load analysis

This page provides simple instructions on how to load an existing measurement to SLMeasure.

## Instructions

+ Using the SLMeasure through the cloned repository
    - Launch MATLAB and double-click `SLMeasure.mlapp`. It is located under `<repo>` folder. 
    - The `SLMeasure.mlapp` file starts the MATLAB App Designer, then press <kbd>F5</kbd> to start the application.

After a few seconds, you should see a program window. This is the main SLMeasure program. (Clicking on any of the images on this page will open a larger version in a new browser window.)
