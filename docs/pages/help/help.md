# Help

If you encounter problems, we recommend the following strategies:

+ Take a step back, and make sure to thoroughly go over the [tutorial](../tutorial/tutorial.html).

+ If that doesn't work, try the following:
    + Verify your microscope calibration and compare SLMeasure results with conventional "ruler on screen" methods.
    + Verify that the loaded image is not compressed or altered. Compressed and altered images will be detrimental. As the analysis relies on the information stored in the images.

+ If that doesn't work, [submit an issue](https://github.com/Campbell-Muscle-Lab/SLMeasure).

+ If you don't hear back in 3 days, [email Utku Gulbulak, PhD](mailto:utku.gulbulak@uky.edu) or [email Ken Campbell, PhD](mailto:k.s.campbell@uky.edu).
